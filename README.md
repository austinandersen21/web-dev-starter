# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running this project
The project for the M3.2 Lab is in the root directory named "letter.html" and the corresponding CSS file is in the CSS directory named "letter-style.css." For some reason using the "127.0.0.1:3000" URL brought up the other html file, however using the preview button on VSCode allowed me to view letter.html.
